Please wait to start with the job until we have had a chance to make sure that you have all the details and that everything is clear.

I run several e-commerce shops built in Next.js. (fysia.se, therabands.se and oxogoodgrip.se) 

This job is to try to implement a new product list and product details page using data from our existing APIÂ´s. 

I have tried to design the two pages here in figma -> https://www.figma.com/file/mrSFmJXCHFaoYbRWaiVjaL/Job-for--Denis-Kiprono?type=design&node-id=4%3A3001&mode=design&t=ok3PnpVjjrCcWa8q-1

My hope is to get a Qwik app with Tailwind styling that we test and investigate performance on.  

The product details page should fetch data from this URL: 
https://api.fysia.se/procarenordicapi/slugData?canonicalRoot=fysia.se&slug=theraband-traningsband-45m-rod

The product list page should fetch data from this URL:
https://api.fysia.se/procarenordicapi/slugData?canonicalRoot=fysia.se&slug=45m

You will find many image objects in the JSON. I have attached an image to describe how to link to images on our CDN: s.fysia.se 

I have bought your most expensive package. I do not need 10 pages. I am more interested in getting 2 pages done right with their responsive counterpart. Notice the responsive design below the desktop designs in figma.

As a part of your delivery, I would like you to commit your code to this private Github repo: https://github.com/procare-nordic/qwik-experiment

I have given the Github user boratechlife access.
